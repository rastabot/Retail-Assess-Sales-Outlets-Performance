# Retail-Assess-Sales-Outlets-Performance
<b>Final Project for the practicum100 program</b>
Context:
The dataset contains data on purchases made at the building-material retailer Home World. All of its customers have membership cards. Moreover, they can become members of the store's loyalty program for $20 per month. The program includes discounts, information on special offers, and gifts

Our Goal should be to asses how the sales perform per outlet and come up with recommendations or insights which might help the retailer in the future
